# ðŸŽ™ MEDIA

## Introduction
For the first time ever, and only available on the Babylonia.app, our media platform integrates the latest of web3 solutions with the transitional social media. You can follow the latest news and articles of the web, the tweets of your favorite person on Twitter and watch the subscribed videos on YouTube. Also, enjoy the most popular and related podcasts in  technology or cryptocurrency, and use our internet radio player to listen to jams. All in one account, all with web3.

## Background

At the end of February 2022, while tinkering about future plans of the website, we came to the idea of having music and sounds on the website for fun as a background, or to kicks in on the mouse hover. Later on the idea grew bigger to have a stream playing and after that the Internet Radio player was born. Playing jams was not enough, had little to do with core ideas of our business, so we dived deeper and the podcast player was added.

After that, the Architect saw an opportunity to integrate the favorite management and personal accounts of social media with the web3 applications. It was a tall order, that may stretch our resources really thin as a small start-up but with the pure ingenuity and hard work of the team, we managed to pull it off successfully.

## Plans

We are we going from here? The next to come is adding video from YouTube and other services, Twitter and Web section to the media. Similarly, the relative videos and feeds to the cryptocurrency field can be fetched and played. In the next phase, we link the Babylonia account and web3 to our media section that user and viewer can manage favorite feeds and videos seamlessly and play them on the platform without login-into the services individually.
