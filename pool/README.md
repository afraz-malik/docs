### CROWDSALE #1 & #2
~~PBTM (BABY)~~ **BABY token** will be available to buy during CROWDSALE #1 & CROWDSALE #2. Before the main launch of the platform, we may decide to covert **BABY token** smart contract **BABY V2** with more features like automatic burn, taxation and locked liquidity, and the tokens will be swapped 1:1 with the new BABY V2 tokens. We are still working on the details of execution and implementation of the plan, also waiting to receive some more guidance through our partners.&#x20;
