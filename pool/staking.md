# Staking

As it is stated on the [Tokenomics](../tokenomics.md), 70% of tokens will be available to the public withing two first years. Here how the plan goes in brief:

1. Total maximum available tokens for Staking (= Yield mining) is 70% of supply
2. If 20% tokens which are designated to CROWDSALE #1 & CROWDSALE #2 are to be sold, 50% of will be available to public minting.
3. The expansion of total supply will be 50-70% / 2 years. That makes 2.08-2.91% a month.
4. The expansion rate is variable, aligned with the demand, will be oscillating between 0.5-5%.&#x20;
5. Preserving the price of BABY against other cryptos is more important than yields & expansion rate.
